<h1>The Marias - My Song Rankings</h1>
<body>
 <!--This is the beginning of my Bio section, I will describe which song I like the most to the ones i like the least-->
    <h3>Favorite songs from their Superclean Vol. II </h3>
 <p>Here I will list some of the songs I like the most from their Superclean Vol. II Album. These are my personal rankings of how I would listen to the most without getting bored of listening to them on repeat. At the bottom of the list, there will be the songs that I personally wouldn't have on repeat. This is either due to them being over played or getting “burnt” on social media. </p>

<!--This is the beginning of the details, where I will list the actual songs in my preffered order.-->
